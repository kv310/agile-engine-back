Agile Engine Challenge (Backend)

For running this app please open a terminal at this current location and run:
1. npm start

I decided to use the structure of Controllers -> Services -> DAOs -> Model/Database

In this example, the model/database is implemented with the Storage class as no real persistence was needed.

Thanks for your time :)
